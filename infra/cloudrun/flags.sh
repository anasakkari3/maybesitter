# --allow-unauthenticated: the app authenticates every request itself with a
#   Firebase ID token (UC-1.0e #144), so Cloud Run IAM would only duplicate it.
# --min-instances=0 keeps the bill near zero; --max-instances doubles as a cost
#   circuit-breaker. Revisit min=1 for production at launch (#205).
# Secrets come only through --set-secrets, never as plain env values.
# Environment is merged, not replaced: infra/scheduler.sh sets
# MAYBESITTER_SCHEDULER_SA_EMAIL and MAYBESITTER_INTERNAL_AUDIENCE on the
# service (the audience is the service's own URL, which only exists after
# the first deploy). --set-env-vars replaces the whole set, so every deploy
# would erase them and the internal job routes would answer 503 until
# someone re-ran scheduler.sh.
